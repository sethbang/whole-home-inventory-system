# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The WHIS team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to [security@example.com]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Provide steps to reproduce if possible
5. Include any potential impact assessment

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and send a more detailed response within 96 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report.

## Security Model

WHIS is designed with a security-first approach, focusing on protecting sensitive inventory data while maintaining usability.

### Core Security Principles

1. **Data Privacy**
   - All data stored locally
   - No cloud synchronization
   - Optional encrypted backups
   - Secure image storage

2. **Network Security**
   - HTTPS-only communication
   - Local network by default
   - Custom certificate authority
   - Rate limiting on all endpoints

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Password hashing with Argon2
   - Role-based access control
   - Session management

4. **Data Protection**
   - SQLite with secure configuration
   - File system security
   - Input validation
   - Output encoding

## Security Features

### Authentication System

- Password Requirements:
  - Minimum length: 12 characters
  - Must include: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
  - Password strength meter
  - Common password check
  - Rate-limited login attempts

### Data Storage

- Database:
  - SQLite with secure configuration
  - Regular security updates
  - Proper file permissions
  - Automated backups

- File Storage:
  - Secure file naming
  - Type verification
  - Size limits
  - Malware scanning

### Network Security

- HTTPS Configuration:
  - TLS 1.3
  - Strong cipher suites
  - HSTS enabled
  - Secure cookie configuration

- API Security:
  - Rate limiting
  - Request size limits
  - CORS configuration
  - Security headers

## Security Best Practices

### Development

1. **Code Security**

## Security FAQs

**Q: Is my data stored in the cloud?**
A: No, WHIS is designed to store all data locally on your server.

**Q: Can I access WHIS remotely?**
A: Yes, but it requires proper VPN setup or reverse proxy configuration with additional security measures.

**Q: How are passwords stored?**
A: Passwords are hashed using Argon2 with secure parameters and unique salts.

**Q: Are images stored securely?**
A: Yes, images are stored locally with secure file naming and proper permissions.
